# Ask AI Makerspace

Huggingface space found: [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JKilpatrick/youtube_ai_makerspace)

## Overview
Welcome to Ask AI Makerspace - a communtiy-driven, open-source project aimed at developing a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application capable of answering questions related to AI Makerspace educational videos and documents. Inteded to be a learning space to get hands-on experience with LLMs and contributing to open-source projects.

Currently Works by pre-processing YouTube videos and retrieving information from the transcripts.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Clean up code and documentation.
     - Started as hackathon project so lots of messy boiler plate code that can use refining.
- [ ] Improve on existing system 
     - Prompt engineering, chunking strategy, automatically indexing new videos, etc.
- [ ] Intergrate public github [repos](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Awesome-AIM-Index).
     - Most videos have a corresponding github repo with the demo code. Would be awesome to have both elements incorporated combining conceptual ideas(YouTube) with code implementations(Github).
- [ ] Develop front-end to move off prtototype tools like huggingface spaces + chainlit and deploy to [aimakerspace.io](https://aimakerspace.io/).
     - More of a long shot goal and priority will be things related and taught in the courses as thats the fun stuff anyways.
